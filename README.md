# thompsonsampling

Thompson sampling is a really great way to run A/B testing. 

The beta distribution is a continuous distribution of the bias of the bernoulli.

I actually wrote a blog post on it here https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/a_b_testing_racket.html that I'm pretty proud of. 

I really wanted to understand how it worked, so I made a website when I was on vacation. 

I have never used this knowledge, but one day I will.
